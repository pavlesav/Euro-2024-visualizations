   Export StatsBomb event data for Euro 2024 to a CSV file (e.g., `euro2024_shots.csv`).  

2. **Open the notebook**  
   Open `code/euro2024.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code.

4. **Example code**
   ```python
   # Plot all penalties
   plot_shot_locations(
       penalties,
       theme="green",
       palette="neutral",
       title="All Euro 2024 Penalties"
   )

   # Plot for a specific player
   plot_penalties_by_filter(
       penalties,
       player_name="Harry Kane",
       theme="green",
       palette="neutral"
   )

   # Plot for a specific team
   plot_penalties_by_filter(
       penalties,
       team_name="England",
       theme="green",
       palette="neutral"
   )
   ```
